## Detecting relaxed selection using RELAX with CYP8B1 gene

The objective of this assignment is to analyze the effect of **'gaps'** and **'number of species used'** in detecting relaxed selection by [RELAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4327161/). However to test this program, we need to have some known ground truth or control i.e., a sequence known to be under strong relaxed selection. Here we choose the gene CYP8B1 which is found and verified to be under strong relaxed selection in some mammals and birds (which come under a common clade called 'Amniota').
