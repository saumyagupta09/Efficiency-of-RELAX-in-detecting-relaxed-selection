## Detecting relaxed selection using RELAX with CYP8B1 gene

The objective of this assignment is to analyze the effect of **'gaps'** and **'number of species used'** in detecting relaxed selection by [RELAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4327161/). RELAX is a hypothesis testing framework that asks whether the strength of natural selection has been relaxed or intensified along a specified set of test branches. However to test this program, we need to have some known ground truth or control i.e., a sequence known to be under strong relaxed selection. Here we choose the gene CYP8B1 which is found and verified to be under strong relaxed selection in some mammals and birds (which come under a common clade called 'Amniota'). 

The test for the relaxed selection of CYP8B1 gene in the amniotes is carried out as per the pipeline mentioned in the [Shinde et al., 2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-019-09903-6?fbclid=IwAR2UL_uHcWkEfqa1GyJsq95N_t_Lcaq7TOn1UpFVNj-2ikDJnUEbHi0ZBCQ#Sec2). The major steps used in detection of the relaxed selection are listed below and a more detailed information is given in projects.
